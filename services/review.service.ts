    new Review('samsung-galaxy-c7-2017','samsung galaxy c7','The 5.7-inch form factor has stuck with the Note line for four generations now, so it definitely holds a lot of appeal. The Galaxy C7 might just be a perfect alternative for anyone who does not need the S Pen and all the extra features - and the resulting price premium - or isnt particularly fond of curved displays.','The Samsung Galaxy C7 is not a powerhouse by any standards. It makes use of a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 SoC with a total of eight Cortex-A53 cores, running at 2.0 GHz. But the real trick to the chip is that it is manufactured using a 14nm process. It is the same fabrication process Qualcomm uses for its top-tier chips like the Snapdragon 820 and is still quite uncommon in mid-range chips.','samsung-galaxy-c7-2017','Apart from the updated design, there isnt anything all that notable or different about the Samsung Galaxy C7. What you get is a sturdy metal unibody with a nice matte finish that luckily isnt prone to get smudged up with fingerprints, all put together with great precision in a neat phablet package. The materials and the build quality are immaculate - wed certainly give them that.','Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow at your service The Samsung Galaxy C7 boots up with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with TouchWiz UI on top. The latest available version of Android bundles cool features like native support for an app manager, Doze mode, and Google Now on Tap among other tweaks. Plus, Samsung has gotten to a point where its interface looks quite refined. The C7 also has the benefit of being quite clutter-free with almost no annoying bloatware, but more on that later.','It seems you can always count on an upper midrange Samsung smartphone to come with a great-looking display. The Korean Giant is pretty much on top of the food chain when it comes to its excellent Super AMOLED technology where high contrast and punchy colors are a given.Sitting proud at a respectable 5.7 inches, the Galaxy C7 is a perfect stand-in for a Note phablet, minus the S Pen of course, among other things. The point is, you definitely wont suffer from any shortage of screen real estand the Full HD resolution and 386ppi still make for an absolutely sharp image. Plus, skipping on the increasingly popular QHD does go easier on your battery.','The camera in the Galaxy C7 is based around Samsung’s S5K3P3 sensor. It is a 1-micron pixel sensor, which has a reduced height of only 5mm to fit into very thin devices with minimal protrusion. It uses the companys ISOCELL technology to physically separate neighboring pixels and limit unwanted crosstalk between neighboring pixels at the level of bigger 1.12μm-pixel based image sensors, which lack the ISOCELL tech.As for the overall camera experience on Galaxy C7, it is quite streamlined. Samsung has included the latest iteration of its camera app, and it works well on the phablet. Launches are quick, and you also get the convenience of a quick launch shortcut - double pressing the Home button.','The Samsung Galaxy C7 is powered by a hefty 3300mAh battery, which is non-removable. However, on a positive note, combined with the 1080p AMOLED panel and a 14nm midrange Snapdragon processor, the sealed-in pack manages to go a long way. Just as a reference, you might recall the Galaxy J7 (2016), which managed to pull a whopping 101 hours of endurance with an identical 3300mAh battery, a 14nm Exynos chipset and a 720p AMOLED display.'),

    new Review('samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus','samsung galaxy s6','The new S6 edge+ just got a bigger screen compared to the S6 edge - 5.7 inches of curved Quad HD AMOLED, and kept the hardware package intact: an Exynos 7420 powerhouse, a great 16MP camera, a plethora of sensors and superb design.','Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ packs an Exynos 7420 chipset developed in-house by Samsung with 1.5 GHz quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU, 2.1 GHz quad-core Cortex-A57 CPU, Mali-T760MP8 GPU, and 4GB of RAM. Save for the slight bump in RAM, the hardware setup is the same as in Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge.','samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus','The Samsungs flagship is thinner and comes with a bigger display. This means the iPhone 6S plus has bezel where the S6 edge+ has screen. The size comparison is clearly not in the iPhones favor.The Samsungs flagship is thinner and comes with a bigger display. This means the iPhone 6S plus has bezel where the S6 edge+ has screen. The size comparison is clearly not in the iPhones favor.','As of the time of writing this, the Galaxy S6 edge+ runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop dressed with the latest TouchWiz on top. The iPhone 6s Plus launched with iOS 9 and you can already download v9.0.2. This is the advantage of Apple developing software for Apple devices - updates are lightning-fast.Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ supports themes unlike the vanilla iOS. Themes can change the wallpaper and icons, core apps such as dialer, contacts, and messages, as well as the notification area.','Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ brings a bigger 5.7" Super AMOLED display of Quad HD resolution. The pixel density is lower than the original edge model at 518ppi, but its still a lot higher than the one on the iPhone 6s Plus.Colors are a matter of taste and Samsung gives you an option of multiple screen modes that adjust both saturation and the white balance. The contrast ratio is exceptional due to the deep blacks. Samsung has maintained their partnership with Corning (those two have a joint venture) and uses Gorilla Glass 4 on both sides.','Samsung has opted to use the superb 16MP Sony IMX240 sensor on the Galaxy S6 edge+, coupled with f/1.9 lens. Its a 16MP sensor with 16:9 aspect ratio thats capable of 2160p@30fps video, plus 60fps and 120fps modes at 1080p and 720p respectively.Thats the same excellent setup thats found in Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge with the addition of an IR white balance detection sensor, a feature we first saw implemented on the LG G4. LG calls this sensor Color Spectrum Sensor, but essentially both sensors do the same thing - they try to analyze the color spectrum of the available ambient light so that they deliver a more accurate color balance.The Galaxy S6 edge+ is equipped with a 5MP front-facing camera, which has a similar F/1.9 aperture and offers Live HDR and color filters as well.','The Galaxy S6 edge+ has a beefy 3,000mAh battery unit, but it has a bigger, higher-resolution screen. Sure, its an AMOLED unit, but it can still affect the overall battery life.Anyway, our battery test shows a minor 2.5% difference in the Endurance rating - the Apple iPhone 6s Plus gets 85 hours, while the Galaxy S6 edge+ scores 83 hours.'),

    new Review('apple-iphone-7-plus-r2','iphone 7','The iPhone 7 Plus hardly needs an introduction. Apples latest always get the attention no matter how much or how little the company has changed. An aura of controversy has always been part of Appls marketing and some might argue that the polarized opinions actually work in their favor.','Apple has equipped the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus with a new-generation A10 Fusion chip. It has a quad-core CPU, a first for the iPhones, with two high-performance cores running at 2.34GHz and two power-saving ones. The high-performance ones run about 40% faster than the A9 chip and two times faster than the A8.','samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus','On the outside, little has changed since the first Plus model - the iPhone 6 Plus. The 6 Plus, 6s Plus, and 7 Plus all share a similar footprint at 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3 mm though they weigh differently. The 6 Plus is the lightest at 172g, the new aluminum alloy, and 3D Touch tech added 20g up to 192g to the 6s Plus, while the new iPhone 7 Plus has shed some weight down to 188g.','The 3D Touch functionality got implemented into even more places across iOS and Apple is fighting well for its last year innovation. It may have started as a gimmick, but its usefulness is growing with each update.You can use the 3D Touch on various app icons to reveal quick actions. But now Apple has expanded those quick actions with system apps by showing an additional row of favorites, quick contacts, recent music, and other relevant app-specific content. When you 3D Touch','The display on the iPhone 7 Plus still has the same specs in terms of size and resolution: a 5.5" unit with a 1080p resolution (thats 401ppi). Its a LED-backlit IPS LCD screen with RGB matrix though the panel has been updated since the 6S Plus. Naturally, it is also 3D Touch-enabled, a technology we first saw on the iPhone 6s.','Apple completely revamped the imaging abilities on the new iPhone 7 Plus. Like its smaller counterpart the Plus shares the updated 12MP sensor that is reportedly 60% faster and 30% more efficient, the brighter f/1.8 aperture that should let 50% more light, the new six-element lens as well as optical image stabilization.Apple reserved its best innovation for the Plus model. On the back, next to the standard 12MP camera sits a new 12MP sensor with a whole new telephoto lens which Apple aims at portrait shooters. Effectively, its a 56mm f/2.8 lens ','The iPhone 7 Plus is equipped with a non-removable Li-Po 2,900 mAh battery, which is about 5.5% beefier than the one of the iPhone 6s Plus, and about the same as on the iPhone 6 Plus. There is also the new energy-efficient Apple A10 Fusion chip, which combined with the new battery and optimized iOS 10, should offer a longer battery life than before.'),

    new Review('apple-iphone-x','iphone 10','The anniversary iPhone is here. The iPhone X. Or the iPhone 10. The name is as confusing as the product itself is game-changing. Tim Cooks vision finally overwhelmed Steve Jobs ideological remnants. A new dawn for the iPhones has begun, free of the iconic Home key and the notorious screen bezels.','It cant be a new generation of iPhones without a new Apple chip, and this year the custom silicon is called A11 Bionic. Apple has moved from a quad-core processor up to a six-core one with a first-ever Apple-designed GPU (previous chipsets used GPUs by PowerVR). There are 3GB of RAM inside the Apple iPhone X.The A11 Bionic chip features two high-powered 2.39GHz Monsoon cores that are 25% more powerful than the 2.34GHz Hurricane ones in the A10 Fusion. The four Mistral cores are power efficient and are 75% faster than the two low-power Zephyr cores in the A10 Fusion. All those six cores can run simultaneously.','apple-iphone-x','The front of the iPhone X has changed the most. There is no Home key, its all-screen you might say, if it wasnt for the notch. The notch is very crowded though - under that grille is the earpiece, which is also a speaker, and a built-in microphone. The selfie camera is around, too, and pretty hidden under the glass is a whole bunch of tech - infrared camera, flood illuminator, and dot projector - all the essentials for Face ID, proximity, and four-channel ambient light sensors.','The Apple iPhone X runs on the latest iOS 11. Now that there is no Home key this iOS version was exclusively tailored for the X with new gestures and functions. Other than that, its the same iOS 11 that was announced back in June. Its not a major or redefining upgrade. Instead, it focuses on refining the design, adding new usability features, and introducing advanced machine learning.','The Apple iPhone Xs most anticipated feature is, of course, the 5.8" AMOLED screen with HDR video support and 1125 x 2436px resolution. The resulting pixel density is 458ppi - a flagship one for sure.The screen has a rather unusual ratio of 19.5:9, taller even than Samsungs 18.5:9.','The Apple iPhone X keeps a similar dual-12MP (wide+telephoto) camera setup as the iPhone 7 and 8 Plus. While the wide-angle sensor sits behind the same f/1.8 lens, the telephoto one has been updated with optical stabilization and new wider f/2.4 lens. A large piece of scratch-resistant sapphire glass is supposed to keep them away from harms way.The iPhone X, just like the 8 Plus, has Sony Exmor RS sensors - the wide-angle camera has a 1.22 µm pixel size, and the telephoto camera has a 1.0 µm pitch as before.','The iPhone X is equipped with a non-removable Li-Po 2,716 mAh battery - about the same capacity as the iPhone 8 Plus. The Low-Power mode, which you can enable manually, should prolong your iPhone X battery life once the charge drops below 20%.The iPhone X ships with a sluggish 5V/1A wall charger which will replenish only 20% of a dead battery in a 30-min charging session.'),

    new Review('htc-desire-10-pro','htc-desire-10-pro','Were not far from the time when the smart in phone will be implied. Prices are falling, market share is climbing - its near impossible to keep track these days of all the new entries in the low end and the midrange. HTCs Desire lineup is no exception - pulled out of the freezer a couple of seasons ago to carry the affordable, mass-market devices of the brand, it has been growing rapidly.','HTC Desire 510 is among the first devices to utilize the next generation of mid-range chipset with a 64-bit processor - the Snapdragon 410. The new chip offers a snappy quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU running at 1.2GHz, Adreno 306 GPU and 1GB of RAM.Weve met with plenty devices powered by the highly popular and widespread Snapdragon 400, so we are definitely eager to see the progress of its successor. As usual our first benchmark - GeekBench 3 - gauges the CPU performance. As it turns out the new Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.2GHz are 25% faster than the older Cortex-A7 running at the same frequency, and on par with the Cortex-A7 ticking at 1.6GHz. The 25% performance boost and the new 64-bit instruction set are definitely a worthy upgrade by our books.','htc-desire-10-pro','The HTC Desire 510 isnt particularly keen on making every millimeter count. At 139.9 x 69.8 x 10mm it weighs 158g and looks it. Compared to another 4.7-incher, the Galaxy Alpha, the Desire 510 is 8mm taller, 5mm wider, 3mm thicker and 43g heavier. Thats quite the difference but, to be fair, these two are not in the same league at all.','The HTC Desire 510 comes powered by Android 4.4.2 KitKat complete with the home-baked Sense 6 overlay. Under Sense 6, the user interface has been improved in terms of both functionality and looks. Each of the built-in apps each has a different accent color but it changes its color when visiting the status bar to create a uniform effect - similar to what weve seen with Apples iOS 8.Heres a brief rundown of Sense 6 UI on the HTC Desire 510.','The display of the HTC Desire 510 has a 4.7" diagonal but the resolution is by no means impressive. HTC has gone for 480x854px which stretches a little thin for around 208ppi.Viewing angles are good for the most part. There is some loss of contrast as you tilt but colors remain intact. Speaking of, the Desire 510s LCD has good-looking, pleasingly saturated colors.','HTC Desire 510 sports a 5MP camera sensor with fixed focus, which means close up shots are definitely a no-go. There is no LED flash to accompany the camera lens either, so the low-light photos are out of the question as well. The camera is capable of HDR shots though, but our unit crashed every time we tried to snap one.','The HTC Desire 510 is powered by a removable 2,100mAh battery of the Li-Po variety. HTC says it is capable of 17 hours of 3G call time or about 27 days of stand-by.In our test, the HTC Desire 510 lasted 70 hours on a single charge, 3 full days with an hour each of calling, web browsing and video playback a day - an awesome score and certainly better than what we expected of it. Obviously the new Cortex-A53 low-powered cores are doing a great job.'),

The HTC U Ultra sets off on a new path of design but stays on the familiar footing of high-caliber camera and audio. A Dual Display makes a surprise appearance as the stalwart headphone jack is left behind.','With a shortage of new Snapdragons, most companies opted for the Snapdragon 821 for their flagship. The HTC U Ultra is one of those phones, along the likes of LG G6, Xperia XZs and a few others.The 821 is a solid chip, but it provides only a minor advantage over the 820, which powered early 2016 flagships. But again, HTC is not alone in this, only companies with their own chipset manufacturing arms can sidestep Qualcomms supply issues.','htc-u-ultra','Now that all-metal phones are fairly commonplace, HTC has shifted to a glass back with a "liquid surface." The effect is similar to a soap bubble - mostly transparent, but as the surface curves away a rainbow of colors appears.Our HTC U Ultra unit is Ice White and before we go on we should note that its very difficult to photograph - to the naked eye the phone appears white most of the time (and its green in the photos). Only when the light hits it at a certain angle can you see the green and pink hues that hide within the glass.','The HTC U Ultra launches straight with Android 7.0 Nougat, same as the Bolt/10 evo. The interface is largely identical, other than the secondary screen and the Companion (which can be downloaded on the 10 evo as well).We start with the fingerprint reader. HTC claims it recognizes a finger in a blink of an eye - 0.2s. In practice, the phone sometimes took longer to be usable - it could take closer to a second before the screen is on and ready for you.','The HTC U Ultra has two screens, the main one being a 5.7" Super LCD5 with QHD resolution (thats 1,440 x 2,560px). The secondary one has 160 x 1,040px resolution, losing 400px of horizontal resolution to make room for the selfie camera.Color accuracy is not perfect - the default mode gets 6.1 average deltaE, 10.7 max. We managed to improve that reading by dragging the color temperature slider all the way to Warm (since the white balance is too cool by default). That only got us to 4.6 average and 8.8 max.','In our HTC 10 review, we dubbed this camera "UltraPixel 2.0." Its not called that officially (though the selfie cam does have an UltraPixel mode), but the return to large pixels instead of chasing high MP numbers was right on the money.The pixels arent quite 2µm big like in the original, but at 1.55µ they still have loads of light-collecting power. The bright f/1.8 aperture over the large 1/2.3" sensor further enhances the cameras performance.In its tool bag are also optica','The HTC U Ultra comes with a 3,000mAh battery that is sealed inside the body. QuickCharge 3.0 fills up the battery fast, but you may need to do it more often than you would like. The smaller (and cheaper) HTC 10 evo has a bigger battery, 3,200mAh. Even the iPhone 7 Plus is not far behind at 2,900mAh.The U Ultra does have a more efficient chipset than the 10 evo - Snapdragon 821 features many refinements in power efficiency compared to its predecessors. Still, in a body this size we expected more.'),

That was Asus line of thought, apparently, which brought us to Rome last week for the European launch of the Zenfone 4. Or rather, the Zenfone 4s. Yes, because they are quite a lot of them.','The ZenFone 3 is one of the first few devices to be running on Qualcomms brand new Snapdragon 625. Unfortunately, its not a particularly powerful processor on paper, so we had our expectations in check.','asus-zenfone-4-selfie-pro-zd552kl','The front of the phone has a large Gorilla Glass panel that stretches end to end and has a subtle but palpable curve around the edges (or 2.5D contour as its known). In the middle is the 5.5-inch display flanked by sizable but not substantial bezels.Above the display are the earpiece, the sensors, and the front camera. Below the display are the three navigation keys. Unfortunately, these arent backlit, which makes them hard to find in the dark. Asus continues to leave these keys without a backlight, even on expensive phones, which makes no sense and something the company should reconsider.','The ZenFone 3 runs on the new Asus ZenUI 3.0 running on top of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. The software has traditionally been a weak point of Asus phones in the past, and things havent changed much now.','The ZenFone 3 comes with two display options; there is a smaller, less popular 5.2-inch model (ZE520KL) and the larger 5.5-inch model (ZE552KL) we have here for a preview. Both have an identical resolution at 1920 x 1080px and the other specifications are also identical on paper, including the maximum brightness of 600nits.','The ZenFone 3 has a 16 megapixel Sony IMX298 sensor with deep trench isolation, a six element lens with f/2.0 aperture, laser and phase detection autofocus, a color spectrum sensor and 4-axis optical image stabilization. There is also EIS for video. Speaking of which, the camera is able to capture 4K video.','One advantage of going with the bigger Zenfone 3 ZE552KL is that you get a much larger 3000mAh battery. With an efficient processor and a relatively large battery, we expected the ZenFone 3 to have a good battery life, and it delivered. The phone consistently provided around 6 hours of screen-on time with two SIM cards and medium use. The phone easily gets through a full day of use and those using it sparingly could even get through two days on a single charge.'),
